Written Dr Nafeez Ahmed is an award-winning investigative journalist, change strategist and systems theorist. He is a supporter of XR, the School Strikes for Climate, the Sunrise Movement, etc.

Written after the "fiasco" when XR disrupted the London Underground, angering and alienating  commuters from East London, many black and ethnic minorities. He hopes the movement continues to succeed: "This piece is not an attack on XR. It is a call to do better".

"XR is at risk of alienating the mass support it has built up, and aspires to continue to build up, due to a defective theory of change based on limited and selective readings of the relevant social science literature". He gives 4 constructive recommendations to improve.

## Critique:

###  Mass arrests as the core strategy
Roger Hallam (co-founder and chief strategist of XR) mass arrests as the principal tactical approach of XR protest actions; this has been reiterated by other influential XR activists. They  
* explain that the strategy was derived from social movements for large-scale change (e.g. US Civil Rights movement - Martin Luther Kind, Indian's Independence movement - Gandhi).
* point to research indicating that 3,5% committed to a cause and participating in non-violent protests have a good guarantee of success.

### Two major movements by people of colour that inspired XR — and why XR has wrongly expropriated them

The author finds the fundamental problem that black civil rights and Indian independence movements were not about pushing for comprehensive system-change, but had more specific goals. Therefore, there's questions about how can they apply to the XR cause.
* Black Civil Rights Movement:
  * Grassroots, broad based. Related to the suffering of black communities, aimed at ending the segregation, racism, discrimination and violence against them.
  * It worked because the people who drove the movement were the very same who were suffering at the hands of the racist violence they wanted to change
  * Disruption actions were targeted precisely at disrupting the system of injustice that was breaching their rights
* Indian Independence movement
  * Premised on the reality of massive, widespread discontent and opposition to British rule, and violence against Indians.
  * Started in a grassroots way from the lower castes, took years of organizing, bridge building between disparate communities and networks
  * Used different types of targeted disruption actions, which coalesced into mass mobilizations. Goal was to repel British rule
Both disrupted an existing, highly visible regime of oppressive violence targeted at the subject communities of the movement. The movement thus lacked legitimacy in these communities. Both were people of color vs white supremacism. Both aimed at directly increasing the costs of the repressive violence.

This model cannot be directly applied to the modern Western context: structures of power are far more complex, repression more invisible, and the institutions being targeted have no intuitively obvious connection to the demand being made. Mass arrests of largely privileged white people to make the government capitulate to XR’s demands about climate change does not follow from the logic of these historical cases.

White people are not being brutalised en masse by a repressive state apparatus. Therefore, overwhelming it through mass arrests will not force the police and authorities to reconsider their violent tactics. Instead, it will provoke escalation of police-state powers in a way that could turn popular opinion against the movement, due to its lack of connection with the grievances and challenges experienced by the majority of citizens, white, black, brown and beyond.

In both the American civil rights and Indian independence movements, there was a direct, organic connection between the people protesting, grassroots communities affected by the issues being protested, and the repressive institutions being disrupted through direct action. That is why they were able to build momentum rapidly. This is simply not the case with current XR strategies.

### 3.5 percent for system change?

Hallam cites the work of Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan, who concludes that nonviolent protests which engage a threshold of no less than 3.5 percent of the population, invariably succeed in producing serious political change.

This is wrongly extrapolated to XR's goals because the 3,5% figure comes from a database comparing nonviolent and violent resistance strategies aimed at producing “regime change”, mainly in conflict settings concerning authoritarian regimes. Very few of these cases involve overthrow of a democracy, none of them involved successful nonviolent efforts to overthrow or change a Western liberal democracy.

Chenoweth's work comes from a book "Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", claimed to be focused on identifying the efficacy of nonviolent resistance in the context of its usefulness for American policymakers. Instead of trying to understand and study the detail of these cases, the authors seek only to abstract from them the tools they want. In the Indian Independence and the South Africa Apartheid, focus is put on the non-violent parts, while ignoring the violent sections in both cases (1948 Accra Riots in India, 1970-1990 armed struggle in South Africa).

The issue the author finds with the research is that research it's done in an Eurocentric context which has sought to interpret disparate global struggles as efforts to ‘join’ a Western-dominated liberal world system, and so don't integrate other social movements from the Global South, overlooking grassroots struggles and alternative social visions of many indigenous nonviolent resistance movements.

None of the cases studied are aimed at producing the necessary scale of comprehensive economic, political, and cultural system transformation, encompassing finance, energy, food, water, infrastructure, society, culture, and beyond, to avoid climate catastrophe.

The 3,5% research involves 323 cases using a wide range of different strategies with mass arrests figuring as just one potential approach of a wide diversity of strategies building on years of community mobilisation, unlike XR’s current fixation on mass arrests.

Furthermore, Chenoweth and Stephan quote and affirm Rutgers University sociologist Kurt Schock’s conclusion that nonviolent strategies don’t work as well in democracies as they do in non-democratic regimes — a finding largely corroborated by their data.

### The Gene Sharp model and XR’s arrest strategy

XR’s strategy comes from the unfounded belief that these nonviolent strategies can be mobilised to effectively “shut down” the capital city until the government is forced to capitulate to XR’s demands. According to Hallam, this view is constructed from the studies of Harvard scholar Gene Sharp.

Sharp’s theory of change is about using nonviolent methods to overturn or devolve centralised states. Like the 3,5% research, Sharp's work is based principally on the study of resistance against dictatorships.

His model is based on the idea that for a government to function, it relies on a baseline of “consent” from wider society. Methods of exclusively *nonviolent* civil disobedience are mechanisms to “disrupt” this base of tacit public consent by mobilising people to cease their "obedience", which will make the state escalate its violence. As state's violence increases, the more illegitimate is appears in the eye of the public, the more accelerates the disruption of the tacit consent. The intensification of violence by the state ends up collapsing it.

Since all this theory is focused on undermining the legitimacy of an overtly authoritarian regime, there is no evidence that it would apply to a Western neoliberal democracy like the UK, specially without a context of grassroots community-organising in the city being disrupted. What's then missed by Hallam is that XR should be embedded with and mobilised through diverse communities throughout the capital, to ensure they continue to support the disruption action as the state radicalises its responses.

This is why disruptions like the one targeting the London tube system, and related ones which affect ordinary Londoners, backfired. While most people are worried about climate change, they do not grasp the gravity of the situation threatening not just social collapse but even human extinction, and don't see that the very system which marginalises, weakens and undermines them is simultaneously and co-extensively responsible for this extinction trajectory.

Since XR's actions have been developed without consultation and engagement from London’s communities, it's very easy to alienate the sources of mass support it needs in the capital. XR's strategy is likely to lend itself to tabloid criticisms claiming that XR is not actually a ‘mass’ movement, but one by a specific privileged constituency, a criticism likely to be agreed upon by ordinary working people whose lives are being disrupted. The result would be escalating disruption, but haemorrhaging support driving an intensification of police-state powers, with dwindling prospects of XR’s demands actually being implemented.

### The race and class privilege of XR

The race and class privilege of XR’s core organisers means they have very little engagement with the communities whose support they require to be effective in building a mass movement. Both XR activist [Sam J. Knights](https://medium.com/@sam.j.knights/extinction-rebellion-we-need-to-talk-about-the-future-95459aa4d4e0) and Professor Julia Steinberger, ecological economist at the University of Leeds, have written about “XR's complete and utter failure to engage with issues of race.”, citing many specific examples about non-white people badly mistreated by XR.

Like many capitals in the world that XR wants to disrupt, London is a very diverse city —[44% of its residents are ethnic minorities](https://qz.com/337508/london-has-more-people-than-ever-and-44-are-ethnic-minorities/)—, and the [most unequal region in England](https://www.trustforlondon.org.uk/documents/69/LondonPovertyProfilefull.pdf), where almost half of some ethnic minorities experience employment and housing disadvantage and are paid below the London Living Wage.

The same system which is responsible for our extinction trajectory is also hiking up poverty, inequality and structural racism. Diversity is not one of those nice but minor progressive issues that can be dealt with after we prevent extinction. It is a critical precondition for XR growing and sustaining its capability to mobilising the masses.

XR’s diversity problem is not just a structural problem symptomatic of the wider racism in society; it is the result of an insular outlook at the top of the movement. Despite numerous points of criticism received by XR from groups representing people of colour, in the latest version of his XR booklet, Hallam makes only sparse reference to these issues. He advocates that the structural solution is to segregate those groups into autonomous spaces of their own, thus potentially dividing XR up according to class and race identities, which is absurd considering the inspiration in the diverse movements talked about above.

This tone deafness can lead to some of its leadership unconsciously fetishising the extreme nationalism and deceptive tactics of the far-right, like on [this video](https://www.whatisemerging.com/videos/what-can-extinction-rebellion-learn-from-nigel-farage) where  XR’s General Election strategist Ronan Harrington advocates to learn from the tactics of Nigel Farage, [the article includes a back-and-forth between the author and Harrington about this topic.]. XR also attempted to approach the Brexit Party, due to its faux white-privileged ‘apoliticism’ that would see the rise of a proto-fascist party as ‘par for the course’ and perfectly fine for XR to engage in the name of supposedly being ‘beyond politics’.

XR’s inability to integrate race, class and ecological justice into its judgement on such issues is not just a matter of theoretical debate. XR’s too narrow disruption strategy, simplistic ‘apoliticalism’, chronic failure to integrate the concerns of minorities and people of colour, are all part and parcel of the reality that such stances are hopelessly conditioned by a form of race and class privilege that is inhibiting it from fulfilling its momentous potential to build an inclusive mass movement capable of spearheading the system change we desperately need.

## Recommendations:
### 1. Diversifying XR from the top down
XR has been founded, led and designed by a small number of people who are predominantly (though not exclusively) white and middle class. There's work needed to ensure that racial and class insularities are resolved by cementing diversity at its core, and then throughout its operations.

The biggest priority is to ensure that organisationally — core leadership, strategy and other design and decision-making groups — XR diversifies so that it is a more representative organisation.

More diverse campaigns, which include multiple age groups, classes, occupations, ideologies, and genders, are likelier to have links to members of the regime, such that opportunities to create divisions within the regime become more ubiquitous.

Furthermore, a concerted community-organising strategy is needed that involves adapting to, consulting and engaging with individuals, groups and networks that can allow XR to reach across social, cultural and class divides, to enfranchise diverse communities

That also requires diversifying the range of nonviolent strategies adopted. As shown above, XR’s fixation on mass arrests as the singular strategy to cause the state to capitulate has no historical precedent and no basis in the scientific literature. Sharp derived [hundreds of other nonviolent strategies](https://www.brandeis.edu/peace-conflict/pdfs/198-methods-non-violent-action.pdf) which can fully enrol minority groups in designing and engaging in successful high-impact public actions.

### 2. Connecting the climate crisis to class, race and beyond

XR should enfranchise communities by connecting their concerns, grievances, struggles and aspirations with the climate crisis. That requires communicating a systems-grounded narrative, recognising that the crisis of planetary extinction is integral to a broader economic and political system responsible for the challenges and obstacles people face here and now. XR’s demands should be fleshed out economically and politically, drawing on the scientific literature, in order to ‘tell the truth’ about what needs to be done.

XR should seek to connect itself with and thereby ‘tell the truth’ on the science around the system change necessary to avert extinction; as well as the opportunities for a better world offered by such system change. This way, communities across society will be empowered to envisage how the transition necessary to avoid extinction is also the only crash programme that will stave off catastrophe in the future, as well as here and now transform their lives for the better, put food on the table, allow them to enjoy healthy working lives, free them from fear of draconian policing, give all equal opportunities, and allow them to provide the best for their families.

### 3. Connecting with critical sectors

XR needs to explicitly and systematically broaden its conceptualisation of “the regime” which it is disrupting far beyond that of the state, since a vast body of data shows that the modern Western democratic state is not [actually the locus of power and political decision-making](https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/big_business_britain_2_0.pdf). XR needs to connect directly to people, practitioners, experts, etc from across all relevant sectors: energy, finance, agriculture, and so on, to deeply and collectively explore the options and strategies for system change.

XR is in a decent position to spearhead this given that it is already attracting people from multiple professions and sectors — such as medical doctors, scientists and lawyers — and has set-up a business engagement platform. This needs to be pursued strategically as a core XR action. Fossil fuel companies, banks, IT businesses, agribusiness and so on should all be targeted via engagement actions designed to forge channels of communication and education.

XR should prioritise cultivating direct sympathetic ties with the most critical sectors of the existing system which XR wants to change. This is so that channels of communication offer opportunities for education, sympathetic defection, and thus opportunities for those who ‘defect’ to do so while remaining within their institutions and working to transform them from within through internal actions which can also be supported by wider XR platforms.

### 4. Targeted disruption against pivotal leverage points in the system

A scattergun approach to disruption actions designed to simply “shut down the capital” will not work for the reasons described above, but will end up sowing divisions and animosities among the constituencies required to support mass disruption actions.

Therefore, these strategies need to be deployed in a targeted way based on understanding the [key leverage points in the existing system](http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/) — that means focusing actions on disrupting the powerful, not the powerless, with an emphasis on the primary centres of power driving the climate crisis. These are the same centres of power deepening inequalities, debilitating public services, sowing divisions, and essentially destabilising human social, political and economic systems.

Rupert Read has already made a [compelling case for XR](https://medium.com/@rupertjread/truth-and-its-consequences-eb2faa5eb458) to refocus its strategy on disrupting institutions of power, thus situating the movement within the concerns of the 99 percent.

XR can become a locus point for two types of activity: disruption actions, as well as engagement actions; all of which need to be carefully directed at key system leverage points — and in a way which galvanises diverse grassroots communities especially in the cities where actions are organised.
