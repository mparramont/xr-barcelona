# The flawed social science behind Extinction Rebellion’s change strategy

Written Dr Nafeez Ahmed is an award-winning investigative journalist, change strategist and systems theorist. He is a supporter of XR, the School Strikes for Climate, the Sunrise Movement, etc.

Written after the "fiasco" when XR disrupted the London Underground, angering and alienating  commuters from East London, many black and ethnic minorities. He hopes the movement continues to succeed: "This piece is not an attack on XR. It is a call to do better".

"XR is at risk of alienating the mass support it has built up, and aspires to continue to build up, due to a defective theory of change based on limited and selective readings of the relevant social science literature". He gives 4 constructive recommendations to improve.

## Critique:

###  Mass arrests as the core strategy
Roger Hallam (co-founder and chief strategist of XR) mass arrests as the principal tactical approach of XR protest actions; this has been reiterated by other influential XR activists. They  
* explain that the strategy was derived from social movements for large-scale change (e.g. US Civil Rights movement - Martin Luther Kind, Indian's Independence movement - Gandhi).
* point to research indicating that 3,5% committed to a cause and participating in non-violent protests have a good guarantee of success.

The author finds the fundamental problem that black civil rights and Indian independence movements were not about pushing for comprehensive system-change, but had more specific goals. Therefore, there's questions about how can they apply to the XR cause.
* Black Civil Rights Movement:
  * Grassroots, broad based. Related to the suffering of black communities, aimed at ending the segregation, racism, discrimination and violence against them.
  * It worked because the people who drove the movement were the very same who were suffering at the hands of the racist violence they wanted to change
  * Disruption actions were targeted precisely at disrupting the system of injustice that was breaching their rights
* Indian Independence movement
  * Premised on the reality of massive, widespread discontent and opposition to British rule, and violence against Indians.
  * Started in a grassroots way from the lower castes, took years of organizing, bridge building between disparate communities and networks
  * Used different types of targeted disruption actions, which coalesced into mass mobilizations. Goal was to repel British rule
Both disrupted an existing, highly visible regime of oppressive violence targeted at the subject communities of the movement. The movement thus lacked legitimacy in these communities. Both were people of color vs white supremacism. Both aimed at directly increasing the costs of the repressive violence.

This model cannot be directly applied to the modern Western context: structures of power are far more complex, repression more invisible, and the institutions being targeted have no intuitively obvious connection to the demand being made. Mass arrests of largely privileged white people to make the government capitulate to XR’s demands about climate change does not follow from the logic of these historical cases.

"White people are not being brutalised en masse by a repressive state apparatus whereby, therefore, overwhelming it through mass arrests will force the police and authorities to reconsider their violent tactics; and the police as an institution are not directly involved in determining the climate policies that XR demands, so overwhelming them with costs will have no bearing whatsoever on the fossil fuel system, except in the most indirect sense. Instead, it will invoke the escalation of police-state powers but in a way that could turn popular opinion against the movement, due to its lack of connection with the grievances and challenges experienced by the majority of citizens, white, black, brown and beyond"




### Two major movements by people of colour that inspired XR — and why XR has wrongly expropriated them

### 3.5 percent for system change?

### The Gene Sharp model and XR’s arrest strategy

### The race and class privilege of XR

## Recommendations:
1. Diversifying XR from the top down
2. Connecting the climate crisis to class, race and beyond
3. Connecting with critical sectors
4. Targeted disruption against pivotal leverage points in the system
