Written Dr Nafeez Ahmed is an award-winning investigative journalist, change strategist and systems theorist. He is a supporter of XR, the School Strikes for Climate, the Sunrise Movement, etc.

Written after the "fiasco" when XR disrupted the London Underground, angering and alienating  commuters from East London, many black and ethnic minorities. He hopes the movement continues to succeed: "This piece is not an attack on XR. It is a call to do better".

"XR is at risk of alienating the mass support it has built up, and aspires to continue to build up, due to a defective theory of change based on limited and selective readings of the relevant social science literature". He gives 4 constructive recommendations to improve.

## Critique:

###  Mass arrests as the core strategy
Roger Hallam (co-founder and chief strategist of XR) mass arrests as the principal tactical approach of XR protest actions; this has been reiterated by other influential XR activists. They  
* explain that the strategy was derived from social movements for large-scale change (e.g. US Civil Rights movement - Martin Luther Kind, Indian's Independence movement - Gandhi).
* point to research indicating that 3,5% committed to a cause and participating in non-violent protests have a good guarantee of success.

### Two major movements by people of colour that inspired XR — and why XR has wrongly expropriated them

The author finds the fundamental problem that black civil rights and Indian independence movements were not about pushing for comprehensive system-change, but had more specific goals. Therefore, there's questions about how can they apply to the XR cause.
* Black Civil Rights Movement:
  * Grassroots, broad based. Related to the suffering of black communities, aimed at ending the segregation, racism, discrimination and violence against them.
  * It worked because the people who drove the movement were the very same who were suffering at the hands of the racist violence they wanted to change
  * Disruption actions were targeted precisely at disrupting the system of injustice that was breaching their rights
* Indian Independence movement
  * Premised on the reality of massive, widespread discontent and opposition to British rule, and violence against Indians.
  * Started in a grassroots way from the lower castes, took years of organizing, bridge building between disparate communities and networks
  * Used different types of targeted disruption actions, which coalesced into mass mobilizations. Goal was to repel British rule
Both disrupted an existing, highly visible regime of oppressive violence targeted at the subject communities of the movement. The movement thus lacked legitimacy in these communities. Both were people of color vs white supremacism. Both aimed at directly increasing the costs of the repressive violence.

This model cannot be directly applied to the modern Western context: structures of power are far more complex, repression more invisible, and the institutions being targeted have no intuitively obvious connection to the demand being made. Mass arrests of largely privileged white people to make the government capitulate to XR’s demands about climate change does not follow from the logic of these historical cases.

White people are not being brutalised en masse by a repressive state apparatus. Therefore, overwhelming it through mass arrests will not force the police and authorities to reconsider their violent tactics. Instead, it will provoke escalation of police-state powers in a way that could turn popular opinion against the movement, due to its lack of connection with the grievances and challenges experienced by the majority of citizens, white, black, brown and beyond.

In both the American civil rights and Indian independence movements, there was a direct, organic connection between the people protesting, grassroots communities affected by the issues being protested, and the repressive institutions being disrupted through direct action. That is why they were able to build momentum rapidly. This is simply not the case with current XR strategies.

### 3.5 percent for system change?

Hallam cites the work of Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan, who concludes that nonviolent protests which engage a threshold of no less than 3.5 percent of the population, invariably succeed in producing serious political change.

This is wrongly extrapolated to XR's goals because the 3,5% figure comes from a database comparing nonviolent and violent resistance strategies aimed at producing “regime change”, mainly in conflict settings concerning authoritarian regimes. Very few of these cases involve overthrow of a democracy, none of them involved successful nonviolent efforts to overthrow or change a Western liberal democracy.

Chenoweth's work comes from a book "Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", claimed to be focused on identifying the efficacy of nonviolent resistance in the context of its usefulness for American policymakers. Instead of trying to understand and study the detail of these cases, the authors seek only to abstract from them the tools they want. In the Indian Independence and the South Africa Apartheid, focus is put on the non-violent parts, while ignoring the violent sections in both cases (1948 Accra Riots in India, 1970-1990 armed struggle in South Africa).

The issue the author finds with the research is that research it's done in an Eurocentric context which has sought to interpret disparate global struggles as efforts to ‘join’ a Western-dominated liberal world system, and so don't integrate other social movements from the Global South, overlooking grassroots struggles and alternative social visions of many indigenous nonviolent resistance movements.

None of the cases studied are aimed at producing the necessary scale of comprehensive economic, political, and cultural system transformation, encompassing finance, energy, food, water, infrastructure, society, culture, and beyond, to avoid climate catastrophe.

The 3,5% research involves 323 cases using a wide range of different strategies with mass arrests figuring as just one potential approach of a wide diversity of strategies building on years of community mobilisation, unlike XR’s current fixation on mass arrests.

Furthermore, Chenoweth and Stephan quote and affirm Rutgers University sociologist Kurt Schock’s conclusion that nonviolent strategies don’t work as well in democracies as they do in non-democratic regimes — a finding largely corroborated by their data.

### The Gene Sharp model and XR’s arrest strategy

XR’s strategy is the unfounded belief that these nonviolent strategies can be mobilised to effectively “shut down” the capital city until the government is forced to capitulate to XR’s demands. According to Hallam, this view is constructed from the studies of Harvard scholar Gene Sharp.

heory of change was concerned with using nonviolent methods to overturn or devolve centralised states  Like Chenoweth and Stephan, Sharp's work is based principally on the study of resistance against dictatorships


### The race and class privilege of XR

## Recommendations:
1. Diversifying XR from the top down
2. Connecting the climate crisis to class, race and beyond
3. Connecting with critical sectors
4. Targeted disruption against pivotal leverage points in the system
